                <p>Hello guys, sorry for the late post. I’m still getting used to blogging.</p>

<p>So, as you can see on the blog title, it’s about a multi-task guy, who can cook, write, code, and photograph. This&nbsp;post is about food, but I’m not teaching a recipe, I will be talking about the globalization in the food sector.</p>

<p>Since civilization started, people transformed something, into another thing. You know, wheat into flour, flour into bread, bread into Bruschettas! But on the beginning the recipes, and the flavors, would only run the world if someone brave enough traveled to somewhere out of his comfort zone. A clearly example of this is: spaghetti, history aside, they said that it was first seen at China, then people from Arabia would have brought this to Eurozone, and Italia got it! Another version said that Marco Polo showed it at Italia when he returned from China. Whatever is the real history, it’s a example of how Globalization changes everything, even food.</p>

<p>Here at Brazil, we were colonized from Portugal, Spain got here too. More ahead in time, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Africans, Germans, got their feet here too. And that made our culinary the most diverse as possible, we like Spaghetti the same way we like Temaki (more-less), and that goes further, as a big country (kinda the size of a continent), food has its region too. At Northeast we have foods that people from the South doesn’t like, and that’s all because of the people who settled their roots first.</p>

<p>Our food gets globalized too. From drinks to&nbsp;“feijoada”, Brazilian food travels the world, alongside with Brazilians, our way of doing barbecue is different from USA, and our way of eating candies is slightly different too. Globalization is the word that existed even before someone would have thought about the meaning of this word. Food, costumes, ways of talking, even the way of lightning up the cooker. Everything got globalized, somewhere in the world, someone is cooking food from Japan, and Japan is cooking something from another country.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the world, someone is saying a word that was only used at Russia. And that’s good, that’s something we can consider, something we would say: “_Globalization started way before Internet, and post cards._”.</p>

<p>And well, nothing better than food to improve globalization. And as my grandma would say:&nbsp;“In the end, your life is all about eating”. When I stop to think about this, well, it’s entirely true, food connects us, food gives us moments, and tastes that you would never forget in your whole life. These tastes get stuck into your tongue, and explodes in your brain, the most pleasure tastes, or, as life could be, the worst ones.</p>
